Create native mobile apps for your WordPress site! Customize your iPhone, Android & BlackBerry apps, submit to app stores, and more with JoeMobi

== Description ==

The JoeMobi app maker helps you take your website mobile with custom iPhone, Android and BlackBerry apps. Bloggers and website administrators can build their own native apps with no programming knowledge necessary! Set up couldn't be more simple - if you can install a plugin to your WordPress website, you have all the skills you need.

= Customized Mobile App =

Once this plugin is installed, start creating your app using the [JoeMobi App Creator](http://www.joemobi.com/ "Mobile App Creator"). Just choose your colors, upload your icons and header image, and you're done. Then sit back and reap the benefits of having your blog on the mobile scene!

= Fully Native App =

The app you create is a native iPhone, Android and BlackBerry applications - not just a wrapper for your website. Publish your app to the Apple iTunes App Store, Android Market or BlackBerry App World for maximum exposure.

= Why does this matter? =

Users of different smartphone platforms -- like iPhone, Android and BlackBerry -- are accustomed to using their devices in different ways. Your users will get the experience they expect from an app on their device, without you having to know the intricacies of mobile user interaction.

= Notifications =

How does your user know when you've published new content on your website? With app notifications, of course! JoeMobi has push notifications built in, so when you publish a new post, your app users will know right away.

= Let Your Readers Comment =

There are lots of app creators that simply take in your website's RSS feed. But that's boring; your mobile readers want to interact with your site as much as your website readers want to, so we let them.

If you use WordPress's default comment system or [Disqus](http://disqus.com/), users of your app will be able to leave comments. And they'll show up on your website, too!

= App Analytics =

View your overall app usage, number of downloads and number of push notifications, and app usage across each platform!
